# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Convert the NFL Combine Tracker into a Progressive Web App (PWA) that can be installed on mobile devices and work offline.

**Planned changes:**
- Add PWA manifest file with app metadata, icons, and display configuration
- Create service worker for offline functionality and asset caching
- Generate PWA icon set in multiple sizes (192x192, 512x512, 180x180)
- Add iOS-specific meta tags for optimal installation experience on Safari

**User-visible outcome:** Users can install the app on their home screen (iOS and Android) and access it like a native app with offline support.
