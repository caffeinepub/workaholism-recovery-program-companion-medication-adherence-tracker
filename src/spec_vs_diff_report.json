  "summary": "The diff implements comprehensive NFL Combine statistics tracking with a significantly expanded data model. However, the backend implementation uses a complex CombineMeasurement wrapper structure (with verified, notes, attemptNumber, equipmentUsed fields) that was not specified in the requirements. The requirements asked for simple optional numeric values. The leaderboard (Published page) displays usernames and includes sorting, but numerical ranking (1, 2, 3...) is not clearly evident in the truncated diff. Benchmark comparisons and guest mode storage appear implemented. Several extra fields beyond the requirements (bodyFatPercentage, bmi, standingReach, seatedRow, squat, powerClean, dash10yd, shuttleProAgility) were added without being requested.",
