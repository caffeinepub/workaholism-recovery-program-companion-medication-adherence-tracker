# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Ensure the Published feed displays all public combine entries from all users as a sortable leaderboard.

**Planned changes:**
- Verify backend returns all public entries across all users without filtering by caller identity
- Verify frontend Published feed displays entries from all authenticated users, not just current user
- Add sorting capability to Published feed with options to sort by different performance metrics (40-yard dash, vertical jump, bench press reps, etc.)
- Set default sort order to most recent entry date

**User-visible outcome:** Users can view a public leaderboard showing all published combine entries from all participants, with the ability to sort by different performance metrics to see top performers in each category.
