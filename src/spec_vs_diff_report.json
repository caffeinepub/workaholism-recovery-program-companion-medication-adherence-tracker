  "summary": "The diff implements admin authorization fixes, payment gate blocking, and user management UI for manual payment verification. All three requirements appear to be implemented with backend authorization logic, frontend payment gate component, and admin user list with toggle controls.",

      "description": "Subscription status and expiration dates functionality including 30-day access grants",
      "reason": "The Admin.tsx page implements subscription management with 30-day duration grants and expiry date tracking. The BuildRequest explicitly lists 'Subscription duration tracking or expiration dates' as a non-goal. The requirement only asks for simple Paid/Unpaid toggle controls.",
