  "summary": "All three requirements appear to be implemented. REQ-1 (frontend displays all public entries) and REQ-2 (backend returns all public entries) cannot be fully verified from the truncated backend code, but REQ-3 (sorting capability) is fully implemented with sorting utilities, UI controls, and proper metric handling.",

      "reason": "Cannot fully verify from truncated diff. Frontend uses useGetPublicCombineEntries hook but the backend implementation is cut off. Evidence shows the frontend expects to receive all entries, but whether the backend actually returns all users' entries (vs filtering by caller) cannot be confirmed.",

      "requirement": "Verify that the backend listPublishedEntries function returns all public entries across all users without filtering by caller identity",
      "reason": "Backend code is truncated before reaching the listPublishedEntries function implementation. Cannot verify that it returns all public entries without caller filtering or that it includes all performance data.",
